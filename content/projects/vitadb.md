# VitaDB

VitaDB is an experimental, distributed, fault-tolerant database I'm developing to explore core concepts of distributed systems. It's designed as both a learning tool and a potential foundation for production use.

## Key Features

- Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Simple key-value store interface

## Current Status

VitaDB is in early development, focusing on implementing fundamental distributed systems concepts. As the project progresses, I plan to add:

- Transactional support
- Concurrency control
- Performance optimizations

## Tech Stack

- Go 1.21+
- Custom-built distributed systems components
