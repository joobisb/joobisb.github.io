    <p>I just wrapped up vibe coding a fantasy cricket league. Here&rsquo;s my take on what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and what I learned along the way.</p>
<p>Please do check it out at <a href="https://playz.one">playz.one</a> ‚ú®</p>
<h2 id="the-project-fantasy-cricket-league">The Project: Fantasy Cricket League</h2>
<p>We were planning our annual cricket tournament at <a href="https://keyvalue.systems">KeyValue</a>, and as part of that, we ran a fantasy cricket league. Everyone could create teams by picking their favorite colleagues similar to <a href="https://www.dream11.com/">Dream11</a>, where points are awarded based on real-time match performance.</p>
<p>Previously, we managed everything using Google Sheets and Google Apps Script. I‚Äôd been wanting to vibe code something for a while, so this was perfect. Given the time constraints, I was curious to see how much I could pull off through vibe coding.</p>
<h2 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h2>
<p>The first step was deciding what to build with. I had been wanting to try <a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a> for a while, and I wasn‚Äôt aiming to build a separate backend service. I wanted something that came with a backend out of the box, so decided to use <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>. Since Lovable has direct integration with Supabase, it made things easier.</p>
<p>Later on, added few other things as well</p>
<ul>
<li>PostHog</li>
<li>Grafana</li>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>Github Actions</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about these as we go along.</p>
<h2 id="heres-how-it-went">Here&rsquo;s how it went</h2>
<p>I brainstormed the idea a bit using ChatGPT and came up with a rough layout of how the pages and the initial setup should look. I then fed that prompt to Lovable.</p>
<p>Found ChatGPT 4o better than ChatGPT 4.5 for brainstorming, though its mentioned 4.5 is better for exploring ideas ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<p>

</figure></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Lovable generated an initial version pretty quickly. It gave me a solid outline of all the pages I needed, which worked really well. I also integrated Supabase with Lovable, and the integration process was super smooth.</p>
<p>It was able to generate the initial API integrations I needed, which helped speed things up further.</p>
<p>The initial version looked like this.</p>
<p>










<figure class="">

    <div>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="" src=" /images/vibe-coding/2.png">

</figure>
¬†</p>
<p>This was a good starting point. But ofcourse, had to go through multiple iterations to get it to the final version.</p>
<p>After some iterations, Lovable credits ran out. I had Cursor subscription, so I started using it with <code>claude-4-sonnet</code>. To my surprise cursor with <code>claude-4-sonnet</code> in agent mode was working at par with Lovable. The only thing missing was the Supabase integration.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Supabase&rsquo;s MCP server was available, and I integrated it with Cursor. This made Cursor feel like it was running in ‚Äúsuperagent‚Äù mode. It sped things up a lot.</p>
<p>Having MCP server was a game changer. The model could generate the code by verifying changes against the database, making development much faster with minimal &ldquo;please fix this&rdquo; prompts.</p>
<p>Vibe coding felt fun that I impulse bought a domain because, why not?</p>
<p>Since Cloudflare has a very generous free plan with DDoS protection, reverse-proxy, workers, etc. I migrated the domain from GoDaddy to Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Next, I wanted to monitor traffic and app performance. Supabase does provide monitoring, and also offers Supabase+Grafana for more detailed insights. So, I used Grafana cloud for all my monitoring needs.</p>
<p>I also wanted to track how users were interacting with the app, so I integrated PostHog for product analytics. A PostHog MCP server would have sped up the development, but Cursor did an okay job here too.</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs how I ended up with <a href="https://playz.one">playz.one</a></p>
<p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="claude-sonnet-4-is-a-game-changer"><em>Claude Sonnet-4 Is a Game Changer</em></h3>
<p>Sonnet 4 really impressed me. The kind of pattern recognition and auto-fixing saved me hours of manual work. It&rsquo;s genuinely good at understanding context and applying fixes consistently. I did play around with <code>gemini-2.5-pro</code> as well, didn&rsquo;t find it as compelling as <code>claude-4-sonnet</code>. To be fair, most of my prompting was done with claude, so it better context.</p>
<p>Also, the agent‚Äôs ability to use command-line tools and grep makes it much more powerful.</p>
<h3 id="get-your-basics-right-first"><em>Get Your Basics Right First</em></h3>
<p>This sounds obvious, but I can&rsquo;t stress this enough. When I focused on getting the fundamental architecture solid before going all-in, everything else fell into place much smoother.</p>
<h3 id="supabase-when-you-understand-it"><em>Supabase (When You Understand It)</em></h3>
<p>Supabase was powerful once I wrapped my head around it. The Row level Security(RLS) and the <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> functions were particularly useful which solved a lot of my permission headaches. This whole process also helped me appreciate how far you can stretch Postgres.</p>
<h2 id="the-painful">The Painful</h2>
<h3 id="git-commit-frequently"><em>Git commit frequently</em></h3>
<p>Cursor would sometimes hallucinate and get stuck in loops, especially when context became complex. I learned to commit frequently <em>really</em> frequently, because you never know what&rsquo;s actually been implemented versus what Cursor thinks it implemented. Once you have a working version, make sure you commit it.</p>
<h3 id="working-code-but-not-optimized"><em>Working code, but not optimized</em></h3>
<p>I didn‚Äôt expect perfectly optimized code, but there were multiple instances where several APIs were being called when a single one would have sufficed. So it&rsquo;s important to understand the code and flow. Once you figure out the optimal approach, it&rsquo;s better to guide the model rather than asking it to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù in one go.</p>
<h3 id="missing-features"><em>Missing features</em></h3>
<p>Both Cursor and Lovable would benefit from a voice mode. When you&rsquo;re in the zone, typing out long explanations breaks the rhythm. I personally found it very productive to use ChatGPT‚Äôs voice mode and then paste the prompts into Cursor. That worked well for me, though of course, preferences may vary.</p>
<h2 id="technical-gotchas-and-workarounds">Technical Gotchas and Workarounds</h2>
<h3 id="postgres-backups"><em>Postgres Backups</em></h3>
<p>I was using free plan of supabase, and it did not have backups. Hence wrote a Github action to take daily backups of the database, and stored it initially in GH as artifacts and later on moved it to a Cloudflare R2 bucket.</p>
<h3 id="row-level-security-rls-in-supabase"><em>Row Level Security (RLS)</em> in Supabase</h3>
<p>I had to work around RLS in several places, not because it&rsquo;s bad, but because when you&rsquo;re moving fast, the security model can become a bottleneck if not planned well.</p>
<p><code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> functions help, but you need to be cautious of security path hijacking. Running with elevated privileges is powerful, but dangerous if misused.</p>
<h3 id="domain-and-cloudflare-setup"><em>Domain and Cloudflare Setup</em></h3>
<p>I used Cloudflare workers to reverse proxy a subdomain for PostHog analytics. Even subdomains get blanket blocked if they detect tracking/analytics, so be aware of that.</p>
<p>A CNAME record would‚Äôve worked, but PostHog required rewriting host headers which is only available on Cloudlare&rsquo;s enterprise plan. So, the alternative was to use Cloudflare Workers, which come with a 100k requests/day free quota, more than enough for my use case.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I think we are at a stage where we can&rsquo;t go back to a world without AI-assisted development.
But at the same time, I think it&rsquo;s very crucial to get your fundamentals right to make the most out of AI. Those who understand this would be the ones who can leverage AI to its full potential.</p>
<p>Would I do it again? Absolutely. But next time, I&rsquo;m starting with a better plan and keeping that git commit habit from day one üôÇ.</p>
